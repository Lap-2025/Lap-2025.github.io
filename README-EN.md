# Linguagens e Ambientes de Programação (2025 Edition)

(Para ler esta página em português, clique [aqui](README.md))

The curriculum of this course covers the fundamentals of programming language design, using functional programming in OCaml as a vehicle for a broader understanding of the concepts.

Corrections and suggestions are very much welcomed. (e-mail: i.chirica \<at> campus.fct.unl.pt)

## Referências

The primary reference for the course is the book "OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful" by Michael R. Clarkson and others. The book is freely available online at OCaml Programming: [OCaml programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/). In addition to the course materials, instructors encourage reading the book and completing the exercises it proposes. The book also includes lecture videos from Cornell University's CS3110 course, recorded during the pandemic.

During lectures, references will be made to materials from other books freely available online from the [Books On OCaml](https://ocaml.org/books) page. Namely:

* "OCaml from the Very Beginning" by John Whitington. The book is freely available online at [OCaml From the Very Beginning](https://ocaml-book.com/).

* "Introduction to OCaml" by Jason Hickey. The book is freely available online at [Introduction to OCaml](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf).

* "Real World OCaml" by Yaron Minsky, Anil Madhavapeddy, and Jason Hickey. The book is freely available online at [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/).
